# Stand Time

TLDR: two stopwatches that can keep track of two different things... like sitting vs standing

---

Last year I decided I would upgrade my home office setup by getting a motorized desk so I could alternate between sitting and standing while working. Turns out that when given the choice, I really like sitting. So I built this in hopes that seeing my total sit time will motivate me to stand more. I also needed a simple enough project to level up my react skills.
