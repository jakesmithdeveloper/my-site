# Understanding GatsbyJS (and my site)

In 2020 I finally got around to making a personal website with the domain name I've been holding on to since 2018. This was just a basic static site that was meant to be more of a landing page for future projects. The main creative idea behind this site entailed my bitmoji behind a css generated laptop screen with clickable stickers that would direct you to the various places you can find me online.
